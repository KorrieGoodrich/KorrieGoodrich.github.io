            <p>ASPIRE stands for Advancing Sustainability through Powered Infrastructure for Roadway Electrification. ASPIRE is focused on creating 
                electric roads which will allow for wireless charging while electric cars drive over the road.<br><br>
                
                During my time at ASPIRE, I created two datasets. One is a list of every electric vehicle owned and registered in 15 different states
                throughout the United States. This dataset is over 10 million rows and required extensive cleaning. The other dataset I created was a list 
                of most of the electric vehicles available in the United States with different specs like the range, original MSRP, body type, 
                number of doors, and number of seats.
