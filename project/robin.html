            <h2>The Beginning</h2>

            <p>Robin is my Brittany. She is the best dog. I have raised her since birth as well as her mother, Bella, and her grandmother, Mo. <br><br>
                Robin was the third born of seven puppies. While we raised them, her siblings' names were Gretchen, Milo, Eyeballs, Rosie, 
                Thaddeus, and Seven. For a long time, a lot of them didn't have names. Only the two boys, Milo and Thaddeus, were named at birth. <br><br>

                I don't know where the name Gretchen came from, but the others all have stories. Milo and Thaddeus were named after the animated 
                movie <i>'Atlantis: The Lost Empire'</i>. Eyeballs was the first to open her eyes, hence, Eyeballs. Rosie was the runt and I 
                wanted to give her a cute name, and Seven was the seventh puppy born. We also used to have a dog named Seven, so her name was a 
                nod to her predecessor.<br><br><br><br>
